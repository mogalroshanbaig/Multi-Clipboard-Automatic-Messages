# Multi-Clipboard-Automatic-Messages
When we have to respond to a large number of emails with similar phrasing, we have to do repetitive typing. 
So to make this task easy may be we keep text document with these phrases so we can easily copy and paste them using the clipboard. 
But our clipboard can only store one message at a time. This project makes it bit easier.
In this project I have used the three Phrases, when the Phrase is entered the stored message is copied to clip board.
We can use the copied message.The Phrases are:
'agree':Yes, I agree. That sounds fine to me.
'busy':Sorry, can we do this later this week or next week?
'upsell':Would you consider making this a monthly donation?
